This folder contains two representative examples of my SAS programming work with large, complex health care datasets. Both code samples were developed as part of retrospective cohort studies using Medicare Fee-for-Service claims (Parts A, B, and D). These programs demonstrate my experience with:

	•	Longitudinal cohort construction
	•	Managing and cleaning large-scale datasets
	•	Applying eligibility criteria based on continuous enrollment
	•	Conducting survival analyses and time-to-event modeling
	•	Generating descriptive statistics for outcome assessment



Both code samples were developed as part of ongoing research projects that are still in progress or under revision. While the code may not yet be fully finalized or optimized, I hope it provides a clear reflection of my current skill level and my ability to work with complex healthcare data. I am eager to continue improving through further training, collaboration, and hands-on experience.
