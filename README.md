This folder contains two representative examples of my SAS programming work with large, complex health care datasets. Both code samples were developed as part of retrospective cohort studies using Medicare Fee-for-Service claims (Parts A, B, and D). These programs demonstrate my experience with:
	•	Longitudinal cohort construction
	•	Managing and cleaning large-scale datasets
	•	Applying eligibility criteria based on continuous enrollment
	•	Conducting survival analyses and time-to-event modeling
	•	Generating descriptive statistics for outcome assessment
